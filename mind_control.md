Lightning Shields from Winterfall Shaman can be applied to the same target of a Bloodscalp/Magram Lightning Shield at the same time (but Bloodscalp and Magram don't stack with each other). Winterfall Lightning Shields deal a baseline of 112 Nature damage, and Bloodscalp/Magram Lightning Shields deal a baseline of 83.
