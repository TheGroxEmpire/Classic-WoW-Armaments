## FAQ
1.  What is a Proc?
A proc is an effect or ability that happens without player input. These can be random chance ("I got 3 Thunderfury procs in a row!") or expected ("I got the killing blow so that I could proc Spirit Tap").

2.  What is PPM? 
PPM is the average number of procs per minute of any random item or ability, baseline. Something with 2 PPM will proc an average of twice per minute, though it may proc 3 or none at all due to random chance.

3.  What is Spellpower? 
"Spellpower" is shorthand for the "+Spell Damage and Healing" stat. The "+Healing" stat can sometimes be referred to as "Healing Power".
